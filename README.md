# Practical introduction to accessibility workshop - practice page

Test page for a Practical introduction to accessibility workshop. Used to test and experiment with
various accessibility tools and techniques.

## How to prepare for the workshop

### 1. Setup a project

You will need **git**, **Node** (at least v16), and **npm** or some other package manager (pnpm is
prefered, but it is not mandatory).

1. Clone this repo
1. Go into the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 2. Prepare a screen reader

You will also need a screen reader. I suggest one based on your operating system. Try to check the
controls for the screen reader and try to start it.

Feel free to play with it in a browser, but we will cover the basics on the workshop.
