# Practical introduction to accessibility workshop - practice page

Test page for a Practical introduction to accessibility workshop. Used to test and experiment with
various accessibility tools and techniques.

## How to prepare for the workshop

### Setup a project

You will need **git**, **Node** (at least v16), and **npm** or some other package manager.

1. Clone this repo
1. Go into the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
1. Run `npm start`
1. Go to `localhost:8080`

### Prepare a screen reader

You will also need a screen reader. I suggest one based on your operating system:
